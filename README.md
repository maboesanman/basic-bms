# basic-bms
a basic bms player, written as a learning experience in rust.

my goal is to make a feature-light bms player whose internal structure resembles the structure i have in mind for [my cozal game engine](https://github.com/maboesanman/cozal), starting with audio programming, and moving on to graphics. The end result will likely be a very bare bones player. I don't plan on adding controller support or rebinding keyboard keys. That belongs in the cozal implementation.
